## 🛠️ Customization

### Adjusting Class Weights
In the model notebooks, modify the `scale_pos_weight` parameter:
```python
model = XGBClassifier(scale_pos_weight=weight_ratio)
```

### Hyperparameter Tuning
Adjust the parameter grid in RandomizedSearchCV:
```python
param_grid = {
    'max_depth': [3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
    'learning_rate': [0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2],
    'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300, 400, 500],
    'subsample': [0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0]
}
```

### Feature Selection
Remove or add features based on your EDA findings in the preprocessing cells.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: `FileNotFoundError` for CSV files
- **Solution**: Ensure all required CSV files are in the same directory as the notebooks

**Issue**: Imbalanced data warnings
- **Solution**: The notebooks already implement SMOTE and class weights; adjust parameters if needed

**Issue**: Low recall scores
- **Solution**: Try adjusting `scale_pos_weight` or implementing different balancing techniques

**Issue**: Memory errors
- **Solution**: Reduce dataset size or use batch processing for large datasets
